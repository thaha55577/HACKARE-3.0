### Step 3: Remove Old Deployment Scripts (Optional but Recommended)

Your `package.json` file still contains the old `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts. Since GitHub Actions will now handle everything, you can remove them to avoid confusion.

* **Open `package.json`** and remove these two lines from the `"scripts"` section:
    ```diff
    - "predeploy": "npm run build",
    - "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    ```

### Your New Deployment Process

From now on, you **do not need to run `npm run deploy`** from your computer.

Your new workflow is much simpler:
1.  Make your code changes locally.
2.  Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin main
